## My process

Started with the mobile version building each section then adding the desktop code as I went.

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - An alternative bundler to Webpack/Parcel by Evan You.
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Continuing to learn how to use Styled Components more effectivley. There are a few area's that can be tidied up and refactored, and there is some code duplication that needs to be erradicated. CSS Grid works well for the Card layout.

### Continued development

A little more thought needs to be put into reusable components, also make smaller components in some cases would make things far easier later on - navigation links - immediately spring to mind here.

### Useful resources

- [React Hamburger](https://hamburger-react.netlify.app/) - While I could build a Hamburger with some spans and a translate origin animation, this small plugin saves quite a bit of time and hassle on something small and has the added benefit of already having accessability built in.
